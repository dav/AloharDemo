/*!
 * The ALUserStay class represents a visit of a place. The user stay 
 * is automatically detected by Alohar SDK based on user's trace. 
 * Though the detection is quite accurate in most cases, the user stay
 * includes a list of Place candidates ranked. The best match will be 
 * chosen as the selectedPlace.
 *
 * The startTime, endTime records the start/end of the stay. The centroid
 * location is the location Alohar detected for that stay, which is not
 * necessary equivalent to the location of the selected place.
